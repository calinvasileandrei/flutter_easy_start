# flutter_easy_start

Hello, my name is Andrew and I develop this easy starter project which you can use to set up your initial project.

How it works?

Simple, create a new flutter project normally as you are used to,
1 clone this project and replace your lib folder with this one.
2 Then copy the assets folder inside your project.
3 Replace your pubspec.yaml file with the pubspec in the easy starter project, remember to change the name with your app name.
4 Create a .env file with your backend url marked as: BACKEND_URL=https://yourbackend.com
5 Fix all the errors inside the lib folder relative to the project name, simply right click the lib folder and find the usage of flutter_easy_starter and replace     with your project name
6 If the test file gives your error replace also there the package name.

## Now you are good to start :)

My current backend returns for the login a json object with the user (check the model for further details) and a token (JWT Token).

I hope i will release a cli/executable to do all this tasks automatically.

If you want to help this project or do you have any idea let me know :)
